underscorejs-examples
=================

##Overview
This repository contains the examples for my upcoming book "Learning Underscore.js".  

The folders and examples are named in such a way they can be explored outside of the book context.

If these examples prove useful to the community I intend to create a branch after the book is finished (or even a separate fork) and accept further additions or even significant changes unrelated to the content of the book.

##Examples index
The examples are organised in these sections (that match a specific chapter of the book):
